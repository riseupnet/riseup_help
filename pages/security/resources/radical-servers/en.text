@title = 'Radical Servers'


Here is a list of either anti-capitalist, anti-hierarchy, autonomous, feminist, or radical server projects.
Some of them are revolutionary collectives which provide free or mutual aid services to radical and grassroots activists.
Others are more focused on privacy or on decentralisation.
None of them are focused on money.
Riseup is not endorsing these projects, but is keeping a list for people to be able to choose!
Please read carefully the terms of service of the projects, as some may be subject to law-enforcement or surveillance laws.
