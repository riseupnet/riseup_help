## Attack on Anonymous Speech

On Wednesday, April 18, at approximately 16:00 Eastern Time, U.S. Federal authorities removed a server from a colocation facility shared by Riseup Networks and May First/People Link in New York City. The seized server was operated by the European Counter Network (“ECN”), the oldest independent internet service provider in Europe, who, among many other things, provided an anonymous remailer service, Mixmaster, that was the target of an FBI investigation into the bomb threats against the University of Pittsburgh.

"The  company running the facility has confirmed that the server was removed  in conjunction with a search warrant issued at the request of the FBI," said May First/People Link director Jamie McClelland. "The server seizure is not  only an attack against us, but an attack against all users of the Internet who depend on anonymous communication."

Disrupted in this seizure were academics, artists, historians, feminist groups, gay rights groups, community centers, documentation and software  archives and free speech groups. The server included the mailing list "cyber rights" (the oldest discussion list in Italy to discuss this topic), a Mexican migrant solidarity group, and other groups working to support indigenous groups and workers in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. In total, over 300 email accounts, between 50-80 email lists, and several other websites have been taken off the Internet by this action. None are alleged to be involved in the anonymous bomb threats. The seized machine did not contain any riseup email accounts, lists, or user data. Rather, the data belonged to ECN.

"The FBI is using a sledgehammer approach, shutting down service to hundreds of users due to the actions of one anonymous person," said Devin Theriot-Orr, a spokesperson for Riseup. "This is particularly misguided because there is unlikely to be any information on the server regarding the source of the threatening emails."

"We sympathize with the University of Pittsburgh community who  have had to deal with this frightening disruption for weeks. We oppose  such threatening actions. However, taking this server won't stop these  bomb threats. The only effect it has is to also disrupt e-mail and websites for thousands of unrelated people," continues Mr. Theriot-Orr. "Furthermore, the network of anonymous remailers that exists is not harmed by taking this machine. So we cannot help but wonder why such drastic action was taken when authorities knew that the server contained no useful information that would help in their investigation."

The FBI purportedly seized the server because it was hosting an anonymous remailer called Mixmaster. Anonymous remailers are used to send email anonymously, or pseudonymously. Like other anonymizing services such as the Tor network, these remailers are widely used to protect the identity of human rights activists who place themselves and their families in grave danger by reporting information about abuses. Remailers are also important for corporate whistle blowers, democracy activists working under repressive regimes, and others to communicate vital information that would otherwise go un-reported. 

The Mixmaster software is specifically designed to make it impossible for anyone to trace the emails.  The system does not record logs of connections, details of who sent messages, or how they were routed. This is because the Mixmaster network is specifically designed to resist censorship, and support privacy  and anonymity. Unfortunately, some people misuse the network. However,  compared to the rate of legitimate use, the abuse rate is very low. There  is therefore no legitimate purpose for the FBI to seize this server  because they will not be able to obtain any information about the  sender. This  is plainly extra-judicial punishment and an attack on free speech and  anonymity on the internet and serves as a chilling effect on others  providers of anonymous remailers or other anonymous services.

In absence of any other leads, the FBI needs to show that they are making progress in this case, and this has meant seizing a server so they can proudly demonstrate they are taking some action. But what this incident shows is they are grasping at straws and are willing to destroy innocent bystanders for the sake of protecting their careers.

## About the organizations involved

MayFirst/People Link ([mayfirst.org](https://mayfirst.org)) is a politically-progressive member-run and controlled organization that redefines the concept of "Internet Service Provider" in a collective and collaborative way. May  First/People Link's members are organizers and activists who elect a   Leadership Committee to direct the organization. Like a coop, members  pay dues, buy equipment and then share that equipment for websites, email, email lists, and other Internet purposes.

Riseup Networks ([riseup.net](https://riseup.net)) provides online communication tools for people and groups working on liberatory social change. Riseup creates democratic alternatives and practices self-determination by controlling our own secure means of communications.

European Counter Network ([ecn.org](https://ecn.org)) is the oldest independent service  provider in Europe providing free email accounts, mailing lists, and  websites to organizations, activists, and movements that are involved in  human rights, freedom of speech and information in Italy and Europe. ECN is anti-fascist and works towards a just and equal society. Years ago, before  sites like Youtube and Vimeo existed, ECN created  a platform called NGV  where people could upload and share independent video of human rights violations. Nowadays ECN works  primarily with anti-fascist and anti-Nazi movements in all of Europe, providing space and resources to political and social centers.

## Questions / further reading

Q: Doesn't Mixmaster/anonymous remailers enable criminals to do bad things?

A: Criminals can already do bad things. Since they're willing to break  laws, they already have lots of options available that provide better  privacy than mixmaster provides. They can steal cell phones, use them, and throw them in a ditch; they can crack into computers in Korea or  Brazil and use them to launch abusive activities; they can use spyware,  viruses, and other techniques to take control of literally millions of  Windows machines around the world.

Mixmaster aims to provide protection for ordinary people who want to follow the  law. Only criminals have privacy right now, and we need to fix that.

Some  advocates of anonymity explain that it's just a tradeoff — accepting  the bad uses for the good ones — but there's more to it than that.  Criminals and other bad people have the motivation to learn how to get  good anonymity, and many have the motivation to pay well to achieve it.  Being able to steal and reuse the identities of innocent victims  (identify theft) makes it even easier. Normal people, on the other hand,  don't have the time or money to spend figuring out how to get privacy  online. This is the worst of all possible worlds.

So yes, criminals could in theory use mixmaster, but they already have  better options, and it seems unlikely that taking mixmaster away from  the world will stop them from doing bad things. At the same time,  mixmaster and other privacy measures can fight identity theft, physical  crimes like stalking, and so on. Please see the [tor FAQ on abuse->https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq-abuse.html] for more information.

Q: How does Mixmaster / Anonymous remailers work?

A: Anonymous remailers work by connecting to other anonymous remailers in a chain, and every one in that chain removes the mail header information  making it impossible to find the real sender. [The Tor project maintains a list](https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en) of typical users of this and other anonymity systems, and the [Mixmaster home page](http://mixmaster.sourceforge.net/).
