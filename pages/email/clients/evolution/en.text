h2. What is Evolution?

"Evolution":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_software is the official personal information manager and mail client for the "GNOME Desktop Environment":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME. It is Free and Open Source Software, licensed under the GPL.

It is usually distributed with the GNOME Desktop Environment with linux, making it likely available either upon installation of a Linux distribution that uses GNOME, such as ["Ubuntu":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system)], or available via your distribution's "Package Manager":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager. Evolution is also "available for Windows":http://www.dipconsultants.com/evolution/download.htm.

Evolution includes support for email, calendar, address book, contacts, and GPG encryption.

h2. Install Evolution

* Debian/Ubuntu Linux: Most likely, evolution is already installed. If not, @sudo apt install evolution@
* Windows: "Download":http://www.dipconsultants.com/evolution/download.htm and install the windows version.

h2. Setup a New Account in Evolution

# Start Evolution (e.g. Press **Alt+F2** and enter: <code>evolution</code>)
# If you're running Evolution for the first time, you will be asked if you want to restore your settings from a backup file, if you have one.
# Enter the name you wish to have appear in the **From** field to your email recipients along with your email address.  You may also choose to make this your default account in Evolution.
# Enter the following information to receive email for a riseup.net account:
Server Type: Choose either **IMAP** or **POP**. [[What is the difference between IMAP and POP email servers? => email/clients]] %>
Server: **mail.riseup.net**
username: **<your riseup username>**
Use Secure Connection: **TLS** is recommended
Authentication Type: **Password**
# The next screen has 4 sections.  **Connection to Server** and **Folders** can be safely ignored.  Enter how often you want evolution to automatically check for new emails in minutes in the **Checking for New Mail** section, or unchecked to only check for email when you manually instruct Evolution to do so.  The **Options** section allows you to apply spam filtering to your incoming email and to automatically keep local copies of your email to enable disconnected access (applies to IMAP only).
# Enter the following information to receive email for a riseup.net account:
Server Type: **SMTP**
Server: **mail.riseup.net**
check **Server requires Authentication**
Use Secure Connection: **TLS** is recommended for security reasons (StartTLS and SSL are easily compromised).
Authentication Type: **PLAIN**
username: **foobar**
# Give the account you're creating a name.  This is only used for your reference when managing multiple accounts in Evolution and is not disclosed to recipients of your emails.
# Click **Apply**

You're finished!  You now can use Evolution to send and receive email through Riseup's servers.

h1. Enhance your email security

h2. Setup OpenPGP Encryption in Evolution

All that's necessary to work with encrypted emails in Evolution is to tell Evolution the OpenPGP **KEY ID** for your account and then to select encryption every time you send an email.

# First, [[Generate a OpenPGP Key pair => /security/gpg-keys]], if you haven't done so already.
# Go to **Edit** -> **Preferences**
# In the **Mail Accounts** section, select the account you wish to link to your OpenPGP key and press the **Edit** button.
# Click the **Security** tab.
# Enter your OpenPGP **KEY ID** (See the [[Howto on OpenPGP Keys => /security/gpg-keys]] to find your **KEY ID**).  Select **Always encrypt to myself when sending encrypted messages**; this encrypts the copy saved in your **Sent** folder on the email server with your own key so you are able to decrypt it later. UNCONFIRMED!!! **Always trust keys in my keyring when encrypting** enables you to communicate with people in your keyring whose keys you haven't signed.  You can ignore the **Secure MIME** section.  **Please note:** "Always sign" **is not** the same as "Always encrypt"; signing an email is different from encrypting it and does not make the message unreadable to third parties.
# Click **OK**

You are now able to encrypt and decrypt emails in Evolution!

h2. Send Encrypted emails

# Compose a new email
# Select **Security** -> **PGP Encrypt**

The email you're composing will now be encrypted upon being sent!  You can always verify that your email is going to be encrypted by going into the **Security** menu and seeing if there's a checkmark next to **PGP Encrypt**.

Unfortunately, there currently doesn't appear to be any way to enable encryption by default either globally or per contact, meaning that **every time you want to encrypt an email to someone, you have to go to Security -> PGP Encrypt to enable encryption, otherwise your email will be readable by third parties.**
