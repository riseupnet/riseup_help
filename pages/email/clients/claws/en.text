h2. Setup Claws Mail

h3.  The First Time - Setup Wizard

The first time you run Claws Mail, the setup wizard will walk you through setting up an account. If the wizard does not open, see section "Manual Account Creation" below.

# Enter your name/alias and e-mail address on the first page
# Click "Forward" to advance to the next screen
# [[Choose server type as POP3 or IMAP -> email/clients#choose-imap-or-pop]] (IMAP leaves mail on server, POP3 downloads it locally - this means IMAP is a good choice if you have multiple machines accessing the mailbox and POP3 is a slightly better choice for privacy, the POP3 user experience is much faster and it unburdens your [[quota]])
# Enter *mail.riseup.net* for the *Server address* (both for IMAP and POP3)
# Enter your username (without @riseup.net) and password
# Select *Use SSL to connect to receiving server* and also select *Use SSL via STARTTLS*
# Click *Forward* to advance to the next screen
# Enter *mail.riseup.net* for the *SMTP server address*
# Select *Use authentication* (you can leave the SMTP username and password fields blank)
# Select *Use SSL to connect to receiving server" and also select "Use SSL via STARTTLS*
# Click *Forward* to advance to the next screen
# Click *Save* to complete the process

h3. Manual Account Creation

While running Claws Mail select *Configuration > Create New Account* from the menubar.

# *Basic Settings* - enter a name for your account, enter your name, mail address, select POP3 or IMAP, enter *mail.riseup.net* for both the "Server for receiving" and "SMTP server (send)" fields, and your riseup.net userid (without @riseup.net) and password

# Click "OK" to finish adding your new account

h3.  First Time, SSL Certificates

When checking your mail for the first time, and also sending your first message, you will see an SSL confirmation dialog. Click *View certificate* (the fingerprint shown on the image may be outdated):

!img/ssl.png!

On first use claws Mail will store these certificates and let you know if they ever change which may indicate an attempted man-in-the-attack, or just that riseup.net updated their certificates. *Every time* you get this SSL pop-up, [[verify the fingerprints with the ones published by Riseup -> /security/network-security/certificates#complete-verification]]]]!

h3. You're Done!

If you are using IMAP everything should just work automatically.  If you are using POP3 click the "Get Mail" icon in the toolbar to refresh your mail.
