@title = 'Usage Agreement for Mail Accounts'

Your mail account is subject to the following agreements and [[policies -> policy]]:

* [[tos]]
* [[privacy-policy]]
* [[dmca]]

Additionally, we have these policies which relate specifically to your mail account.

* Your email quota will be 96 megabytes. This can be increased upon request.
* Individuals are allowed exactly one riseup.net account. Activist organizations may have more than one account.
* Your mail account may be terminated for the following reasons:
** Using any riseup.net hardware or return address to send spam. Activist spam,
otherwise known as *tofu*, is still spam and will be treated no differently
from the corporate variety. This is to ensure that riseup.net does not get
blocked from delivering mail to other mail providers.
** Account inactivity for more than six months.
