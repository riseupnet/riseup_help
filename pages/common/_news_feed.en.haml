    Our upstream is performing power maintenance work tonight, April 17, starting at 19h PDT and continuing until Saturday, April 18 at 10h PDT.

All mail will be delivered. Thanks for your patience.

  .label.label-success New certificates deployed!
  .date 2014-10-15
  .text
    In our seemingly continous saga to improve security for our users, we updated our certificates today to phase out some older crypto. Now we are using SHA256 and 4096bit certificates, this may result in very old clients (Windows XP SP2, Android 2.2) to no longer work. Unfortunately, we cannot continue to support those and ask that you upgrade. Check out our [[new certificate fingerprints -> /security/network-security/certificates/riseup-signed-certificate-fingerprints.txt]] and learn how to [[verify them -> /security/network-security/certificates]].

  .label.label-success SSLv3 disabled due to Poodle vulnerability
  .date 2014-10-15
  .text
    Due to a [[security vulnerability disclosed on the internet => http://www.pcworld.com/article/2834015/security-experts-warn-of-poodle-attack-against-ssl-30.html]], we have disabled the SSLv3 protocol on our servers. If you are suddenly having difficulty logging in, please take a moment to look to see if there is a newer version of the software you are using to connect to Riseup. Only very old, and otherwise vulnerable software, will fail to connect with SSLv3 disabled.

  .text
    Due to a [[security vulnerability disclosed on the internet today => https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160/]], we had to roll our tor hidden service addresses. This means that if you were using a Tor hidden service to connect to Riseup, you will not be able to continue to use that address. Please find out the [[new hidden service address => /security/network-security/tor#riseups-tor-hidden-services]] and replace the old one you were using with the new one to continue to use Riseup's Tor hidden services!
