h2. Securing your messages

In most cases, when you use Riseup's jabber service your messages will be encrypted in transport. There is, however, not a strong guarantee of this (unless both parties are using Riseup).

If you want to ensure end-to-end message encryption, then your the best options is [[Off The Record (OTR) -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging]]. For more information, read our [[OTR tutorial -> otr]].

Last time we checked, Jitsi is the only jabber client that supports secure voice/video calling.
